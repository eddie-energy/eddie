      # Usage of docker is done through direct commands instead of using predefined actions for these reasons:
      # - Usage of the docker command line is well documented and already understood by all developers that
      #   used docker before. Usage of a docker-related action requires additional knowledge that is seldomly present.
      # - Security tokens are not passed through an action to give less surface to supply chain attacks that might be
      #   used for stealing docker related secrets. That supply chain attack may occur in the used GitHub action or any
      #   library that is used by that action explicitly or implicitly. Especially in the Node.js/npm ecosystem that
      #   must be used by all GitHub actions, supply chain attacks became common in recent times.
