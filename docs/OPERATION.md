# EDDIE Framework operation manual

## Quickstart

A quickstart configuration to run the EDDIE Framework is provided in the `env` folder of the development project. The
steps to make it run are:

1. Download the quickstart configuration folder from [EDDIE /env](https://github.com/eddie-energy/eddie/tree/main/env)
2. Run `docker compose up -d` in that folder.
3. Open browser on http://127.0.0.1:9000/prototype/main/ and experiment with the provided sample application.
4. As many permission administrators and metered data administrators require additional installation or registration
   steps, it's best to try out the framework functionality using the permission administrator called _simulation_.

## Installation

TBD.

A sample container configuration in `docker-compose.yml`:

````yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  eddie:
    image: ghcr.io/eddie-energy/eddie:latest
    environment:
      JDBC_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/example_app"
      JDBC_USER: "test"
      JDBC_PASSWORD: "test"
      PUBLIC_CONTEXT_PATH: ""                                   # default value
      EDDIE_DATA_NEEDS_CONFIG_FILE: "./config/data-needs.json"  # default value
    volumes:
      - ./ponton:/ponton
      - ./data-needs.json:/opt/eddie/config/data-needs.json
````

| Variable                       | Description                             |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `EDDIE_DATA_NEEDS_CONFIG_FILE` | File containing data needs definitions. |

As the configuration of region connectors is quite complex and there are many properties, the environment is
configured in the accompanying `.env` file (see [EDDIE /env](https://github.com/eddie-energy/eddie/tree/main/env)
directory for a reference).
The example `.env` file contains all configuration options.

## Update

TBD.

# Using the EDDIE Button in an application

To use the _EDDIE Button_ in an eligible party application, the EP application has to include the button in its HTML
page. It can be integrated into a frontend based application (e.g. a single-page application) or into a server rendered
web application as it's implemented using standard HTML custom elements.

```html

<script type="module" src="${eddieUrl}/lib/eddie-components.js"></script>
<!-- ... -->
<eddie-connect-button
        connection-id="1"
        data-need-id="9bd0668f-cc19-40a8-99db-dc2cb2802b17"
></eddie-connect-button>
```

`${eddieUrl}` is to be replaced with the public base URL of your EDDIE instance.

The `eddie-connect-button` element can be configured using the following attributes:

| Attribute                           | Type    | Description                                                                                                          | Required |
|-------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `connection-id`                     | String  | The connection id is generated by the EP application _integrating_ EDDIE and is used to identify generated requests. | Yes      |
| `data-need-id`                      | String  | ID of a pre-configured data need. Required if `allow-data-need-selection` is not `true`.                             | Yes      | 
| `allow-data-need-selection`         | Boolean | If true, the user can select a pre-configured data need. This feature is intended for development purposes only.     | No       |
| `permission-administrator`          | String  | Sets a fixed permission administrator to use by its id.                                                              | No       |
| `accounting-point-id`               | String  | Sets a fixed accounting point id for permission administrators supporting this feature.                              | No       |
| `remember-permission-administrator` | Boolean | If true, the most recent permission administrator is stored and loaded from local storage.                           | No       |

The `connectionId` has to be generated by the EP application. It's included in the messages sent by EDDIE
so that button instance can match with the data stream that is created using it. The EP application is also
responsible for storing previous connection IDs and linking them to the users of the EP application. Each connection
id must be used only once to create a uniquely identifiable connection with EDDIE.

# Configuration

It is recommended to configure EDDIE core and the region connectors via the `.env` file in combination with
the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Configuring EDDIE Core

EDDIE Core can be configured by the following environment variables.
You can also modify the [application.properties](../core/src/main/resources/application.properties) file directly, but
the recommendation is to use the `.env` which accompanies the [docker-compose.yml](../env/docker-compose.yml) file.

### Configuring region connectors

To retrieve data from various regions and countries, it is crucial to correctly set up the relevant region connectors.

For each region connector, specific configurations and prerequisites are necessary for operation.
Details for these setups are provided in the README file of the individual region connector. You can locate these files
under `region-connectors/region-connector-<country-code>-<permission-administrator>/README.md`.

Or you can use the following links:

* [Austria (EDA)](./../region-connectors/region-connector-at-eda/README.md)
* [Denmark (Energinet)](./../region-connectors/region-connector-dk-energinet/README.md)
* [France (Enedis)](./../region-connectors/region-connector-fr-enedis/README.md)
* [Spain (Datadis)](./../region-connectors/region-connector-es-datadis/README.md)
* [AIIDA (Near real-time data)](./../region-connectors/region-connector-aiida/README.md)

### Business domain related configuration

#### Common Information Model (CIM)

For the mapping of region specific data to the common information model (CIM) the following configuration parameters
need to be set:

| Parameter                                 | Type                               | Description                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cim.eligible-party.national-coding-scheme | A valid CodingSchemeTypeList value | Most of the time just 'N' + your country code e.g NAT if you are located in Austria |

E.g. eligible party in Austria:

```
cim.eligible-party.national-coding-scheme=NAT
```

#### Data need configuration

A data need describes a configuration for the _Connect Button_. By using that button, the type of data and time frame is
predefined
so that the EP application receives data that it actually needs to perform its job.

Data needs can be configured in two ways: via a JSON file that is read on startup, they can be created via a REST-ful
API which stores the data needs in the core's database.

| Parameter                                | Type              | Description                                            |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| eddie.data-needs-config.data-need-source | CONFIG / DATABASE | Specifies the location where data needs are read from. |

If this is set to `CONFIG`, the property `EDDIE_DATA_NEEDS_CONFIG_FILE` needs to be set, otherwise the file is ignored.
It is not possible to combine `CONFIG` and `DATABASE` modes.

#### Data needs in config mode

See the file [env/data-needs.json](env/data-needs.json) for a full example configuration.
While the REST-API ignores the ID field for creation requests, when supplying data needs via the JSON file,
the ID is a mandatory field.

```json
{
  "type": "validated",
   "id": "9bd0668f-cc19-40a8-99db-dc2cb2802b17",
  "name": "LAST_3_MONTHS_ONE_MEASUREMENT_PER_DAY",
  "description": "Historical validated consumption data for the last three months, one measurement per day",
  "purpose": "Some purpose",
  "policyLink": "https://example.com/toc",
  "duration": {
    "type": "relativeDuration",
    "start": "-P3M",
    "end": "P0D"
  },
  "energyType": "ELECTRICITY",
  "minGranularity": "P1D",
  "maxGranularity": "P1D"
}
```

All data needs have these common fields:

| maxGranularity | String | Maximum accepted granularity. Not all MDAs supply the data in the same granularity, if your application can handle multiple granularities, set this to a higher value than `minGranularity` and the region connectors will automatically retry to fetch the data in a higher granularity if the data is not available in `minGranularity`. |

A data need is mandatory for each _Connect with EDDIE_ Button.

Please see the OpenAPI documentation (default: http://localhost:8080/data-needs/swagger-ui/index.html) for further
details about all possible data need types and their respective fields.

#### Kafka Connector

All configuration values that are available for Kafka producers and consumers are supported,
see [kafka: Producer Configs](https://kafka.apache.org/28/documentation.html#producerconfigs). To include them the
prefix `kafka.` has to be used.

The following parameters are of special interest:

| Parameter               | Type                                            | Description                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| kafka.bootstrap.servers | comma-separated _host:port_  tuples (mandatory) | A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.                    |
| kafka.enable            | true/false                                      | Enables or disables the kafka connector.                                                                          |
| kafka.termination.topic | valid kafka topic name                          | The topic on which the kafka connector listens for termination requests. Optional, the default is `terminations`. |

E.g. if Kafka is installed locally:

```
kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9094
```

##### Termination of Permission Requests

To terminate permission requests, a consent market document in json format has to be sent to
the `kafka.termination.topic`.
The key should be the ID of the region connector, from which the request originated.
The consent market document for termination can look like the following JSON message.
**Keep in mind that some kafka clients use newlines as message separator, in that case minimize the message, or change
the message separator!**

```json
{
  "mrid": "REPLACE_ME",
  "type": "Z01",
  "permissionList": {
    "permissions": [
      {
        "reasonList": {
          "reasons": [
            {
              "code": "Z03"
            }
          ]
        },
        "mktActivityRecordList": {
          "mktActivityRecords": [
            {
              "type": "at-eda"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The MRID should be replaced by the permission ID, the code `Z03` stands for „cancelled by eligible party“ and the
type `Z01` identifies this document as a termination document.
If the kafka message key is unknown, the type of the mktActivityRecord is used, which is identical to the region
connector id.

## Configuring the example app

If you are using the example app and you change configuration parameters for the *core*, you might need to update its
configuration as well.
Please refer to the [readme.md](../examples/example-app/README.md) of the example app.
