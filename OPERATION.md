# EDDIE Framework operation manual

## Quickstart

A quickstart configuration to run the EDDIE Framework is provided in the `.env` folder of the development project. The
steps to make it run are:

1. Download the quickstart configuration folder from [EDDIE /env](https://github.com/eddie-energy/eddie/tree/main/env)
2. Run `docker compose up -d` in that folder.
3. Open browser on http://127.0.0.1:9000/prototype/main/ and experiment with the provided sample application.
4. As many permission administrators and metered data administrators require additional installation or registration
   steps, it's best to try out the framework functionality using the permission administrator called _simulation_.

## Installation

TBD.

A sample container configuration in `docker-compose.yml`:

````yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  eddie:
    image: ghcr.io/eddie-energy/eddie:latest
    environment:
      JDBC_URL: "jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/example_app"
      JDBC_USER: "test"
      JDBC_PASSWORD: "test"
      PUBLIC_CONTEXT_PATH: ""                                   # default value
      EDDIE_DATA_NEEDS_CONFIG_FILE: "./config/data-needs.json"  # default value
    volumes:
      - ./ponton:/ponton
      - ./data-needs.json:/opt/eddie/config/data-needs.json
````

| Variable                       | Description                             |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `EDDIE_DATA_NEEDS_CONFIG_FILE` | File containing data needs definitions. |

As the configuration of region connectors is quite complex and there are many properties, the environment is
configured in the accompanying `.env` file (see [EDDIE /env](https://github.com/eddie-energy/eddie/tree/main/env)
directory for a reference).
The example `.env` file contains all configuration options.

## Update

TBD.

## Integration

TBD.

#### Using the EDDIE Button in an application

To use the _EDDIE Button_ in an eligible party application. This EP application has to include the button in its HTML
page. It can be integrated into a frontend based application (e.g. a single-page application) or into a server rendered
web application as it's implemented using standard HTML custom elements.

```html

<script type="module" src="${eddieUrl}/lib/eddie-components.js"></script>
<!-- ... -->
<eddie-connect-button
  connection-id="1"
  data-need-id="LAST_3_MONTHS_ONE_MEASUREMENT_PER_DAY"
></eddie-connect-button>
```

`${eddieUrl}` is to be replaced with the public base URL of your EDDIE instance.

The `eddie-connect-button` element can be configured using the following attributes:

| Attribute                           | Type    | Description                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `connection-id`                     | String  | The connection id can be generated by application _using_ EDDIE to identify generated requests.                  |
| `data-need-id`                      | String  | ID of a pre-configured data need. Required if `allow-data-need-selection` is not `true`.                         |
| `allow-data-need-selection`         | Boolean | If true, the user can select a pre-configured data need. This feature is intended for development purposes only. |
| `permission-administrator`          | String  | Sets a fixed permission administrator to use by its id.                                                          |
| `accounting-point-id`               | String  | Sets a fixed accounting point id for permission administrators supporting this feature.                          |
| `remember-permission-administrator` | Boolean | If true, the most recent permission administrator is stored and loaded from local storage.                       |

The `connectionId` has to be generated by the EP application. It's included in the messages sent by EDDIE
so that button instance can match with the data stream that is created using it. The EP application is also
responsible for storing previous connection IDs and linking them to the users of the EP application. Each connection
id must be used only once to create a uniquely identifiable connection with EDDIE.

## Configuration

Configuration parameters can be modified in the following locations:

- **Environment variables**: They are described in the _Installation_ section of this document.
- `data-needs.json`: This file contains the data needs configuration. It's intended content is described in the section
  _data need configuration_.
- `application.properties`: A base configuration is provided inside the application, but additional values are
  required that can be supplied in EDDIE's runtime directory (`./application.properties`). The base
  configuration is located
  at [core/src/main/resources/application.properties](https://github.com/eddie-energy/eddie/blob/main/core/src/main/resources/application.properties).

### Business domain related configuration

#### Common Information Model (CIM)

For the mapping of region specific data to the common information model (CIM) the following configuration parameters
need to be set:

| Parameter                                 | Type                               | Description                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cim.eligible-party.national-coding-scheme | A valid CodingSchemeTypeList value | Most of the time just 'N' + your country code e.g NAT if you are located in Austria |

E.g. eligible party in Austria:

```
cim.eligible-party.national-coding-scheme=NAT
```

#### Data need configuration

A data need describes a configuration for the _Connect Button_. By using that button, the type of data and time frame is
predefined
so that the EP application receives data that it actually needs to perform its job.

Data needs can be configured in two ways: via a JSON file that is read on startup, they can be created via a REST-ful
API which stores the data needs in the core's database.

| Parameter                                | Type              | Description                                            |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| eddie.data-needs-config.data-need-source | CONFIG / DATABASE | Specifies the location where data needs are read from. |

If this is set to `CONFIG`, the property `EDDIE_DATA_NEEDS_CONFIG_FILE` needs to be set, otherwise the file is ignored.
It is not possible to combine `CONFIG` and `DATABASE` modes.

##### Data needs in configuration

See the file [env/data-needs.json](env/data-needs.json) for a full example configuration.
While the REST-API ignores the ID field for creation requests, when supplying data needs via the JSON file,
the ID is a mandatory field.

```json
{
  "type": "validated",
  "id": "LAST_3_MONTHS_ONE_MEASUREMENT_PER_DAY",
  "name": "LAST_3_MONTHS_ONE_MEASUREMENT_PER_DAY",
  "description": "Historical validated consumption data for the last three months, one measurement per day",
  "purpose": "Some purpose",
  "policyLink": "https://example.com/toc",
  "duration": {
    "type": "relativeDuration",
    "start": "-P3M",
    "end": "P0D"
  },
  "energyType": "ELECTRICITY",
  "minGranularity": "P1D",
  "maxGranularity": "P1D"
}
```

All data needs have these common fields:

| Attribute   | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                         |
|-------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| type        | String | Type of the data need, e.g. `validated` for historical validated consumption data. Please check the OpenAPI documentation for all supported values. |
| id          | String | Unique id that can be used to reference this data need.                                                                                             |
| name        | String | Short memorable name of the data need that may be presented to the customer.                                                                        |
| description | String | Multiline string that describes this data need in a human readable form to be shown in the UI. May be formatted using Markdown.                     |
| purpose     | String | Multiline string that describes the purpose of this data need. May be formatted using Markdown.                                                     |
| policyLink  | URL    | URL to the data policy that applies to this data need.                                                                                              |

Depending on the `type`, a data need may require more fields, e.g. for validated historical consumption data:

| Attribute      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| duration       | Object | Describes the timeframe for this data need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| energyType     | String | Type of energy to be requested. See OpenAPI documentation for all possible values.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| minGranularity | String | Desired granularity of the data that should be requested.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| maxGranularity | String | Maximum accepted granularity. Not all MDAs supply the data in the same granularity, if your application can handle multiple granularities, set this to a higher value than `minGranularity` and the region connectors will automatically retry to fetch the data in a higher granularity if the data is not available in `minGranularity`. |

A data need is mandatory for each _Connect with EDDIE_ Button.

Please see the OpenAPI documentation (default: http://localhost:8080/data-needs/swagger-ui/index.html) for further
details about all possible data need types and their respective fields.

### External system related

#### Kafka Connector

All configuration values that are available for Kafka producers and consumers are supported,
see [kafka: Producer Configs](https://kafka.apache.org/28/documentation.html#producerconfigs). To include them the
prefix `kafka.` has to be used.

The following parameters are of special interest:

| Parameter               | Type                                            | Description                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| kafka.bootstrap.servers | comma-separated _host:port_  tuples (mandatory) | A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.                    |
| kafka.enable            | true/false                                      | Enables or disables the kafka connector.                                                                          |
| kafka.termination.topic | valid kafka topic name                          | The topic on which the kafka connector listens for termination requests. Optional, the default is `terminations`. |

E.g. if Kafka is installed locally:

```
kafka.bootstrap.servers=localhost:9093
```

##### Termination of Permission Requests

To terminate permission requests, a consent market document in json format has to be sent to
the `kafka.termination.topic`.
The key should be the ID of the region connector, from which the request originated.
The consent market document for termination can look like the following JSON message.
**Keep in mind that some kafka clients use newlines as message separator, in that case minimize the message, or change
the message separator!**

```json
{
  "mrid": "REPLACE_ME",
  "type": "Z01",
  "permissionList": {
    "permissions": [
      {
        "reasonList": {
          "reasons": [
            {
              "code": "Z03"
            }
          ]
        },
        "mktActivityRecordList": {
          "mktActivityRecords": [
            {
              "type": "at-eda"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The MRID should be replaced by the permission ID, the code `Z03` stands for „cancelled by eligible party“ and the
type `Z01` identifies this document as a termination document.
If the kafka message key is unknown, the type of the mktActivityRecord is used, which is identical to the region
connector id.
