# Positioning Note
## EDDIE as a Common and Federated Energy Data Space for a participative, digital and sustainable energy system

## Positioning Statement

**EDDIE is not designed to commercialise energy data as a primary objective.**  
Instead, EDDIE establishes the **technical, organisational, and governance foundations** for a **participative, sustainable, and digital energy system**, where energy data can be **exchanged responsibly, interoperably, and under full sovereignty of the final customer**.
    

EDDIE’s role is to **enable system-wide participation and transformation**, not to act as a data marketplace or brokerage platform.

## What EDDIE *Is*

EDDIE is a **decentralised energy data space infrastructure** that:

- Enables **secure, consent-based access** to energy-related data
- Supports **cross-border and cross-sector interoperability**
- Reduces the cost and complexity of data integration
- Empowers **citizens, communities, service providers, researchers, and system operators**
- Supports sustainability, flexibility, and digitalisation of energy systems

EDDIE basically consists of 
- the **EDDIE Framework**, as a pan-European interoperability middleware
- **AIIDA - Administrative Interface for In-House Data Access**, as a cloud-edge device to account for close-to-realtime and bi-directional communication between market actors & system operators, and active customers.

EDDIE treats energy data as a **shared system resource**, governed by trust, transparency, and regulation — not as a commodity by default.

---

## What EDDIE *Is Not*

EDDIE is **not**:

- A central European energy data hub
- A commercial data marketplace or broker
- A platform for monetising personal energy data
- A proprietary or vendor-controlled ecosystem

Commercial services may emerge **on top of EDDIE**, but **EDDIE itself remains neutral infrastructure**, comparable to open internet protocols or grid interoperability standards.

---

## Why This Positioning Matters

This positioning ensures that EDDIE:

- Aligns with public-interest energy and data policy goals
- Builds **consumer trust and social acceptance**
- Enables long-term sustainability under foundation governance
- Avoids premature market concentration or platform dominance

EDDIE creates the **conditions for innovation and value creation** without prescribing who captures that value or how.
