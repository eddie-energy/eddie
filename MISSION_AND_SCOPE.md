### Project Name

**EDDIE – European Distributed Data Infrastructure for Energy**

---

### 1. Purpose

The purpose of the EDDIE project is to develop and maintain **open-source, decentralised software infrastructure** that enables **interoperable, secure, and consent-based access to energy data** across systems, jurisdictions, and actors.

EDDIE supports the transition toward a **participative, sustainable, and digital energy system** by lowering technical, organisational, and regulatory barriers to responsible data sharing.

The Clean Energy Package establishes customer rights to access energy data and share it with chosen eligible parties, fostering the development of new data-driven services within and beyond the energy sector. However, the lack of standardized procedures across the EU poses a significant obstacle to the implementation of such solutions. Currently, actors adhere to national practices, hindering interoperability and limiting growth opportunities. These challenges have broad implications on an industrial, economic, and social scale in Europe and beyond. 

To address these issues, EDDIE introduces a decentralized, distributed, open-source Data Space, in alignment with the efforts of the EU Smart Grids Task Force on Implementing Acts on Interoperability and other European initiatives. The European Distributed Data Infrastructure for Energy (EDDIE) significantly reduces data integration costs, allowing energy service companies to operate and compete seamlessly in a unified European market. Additionally, an Administrative Interface for In-house Data Access (AIIDA) ensures secure and reliable access to valuable real-time data based on customer consent.

Having been created under the umbrella of Horizon Europe Project EDDIE ( https://eddie.energy ), both the EDDIE Framework and AIIDA are being extended to support further functional building blocks as required by the **Common European Energy Data Space (CEEDS)**.

### 2. Scope

#### In Scope

- Open-source reference implementations for:
    - Interoperable access to energy data, and key participative energy services (e.g. access to metering and consumption data, market communication for energy sharing, etc.)
    - Consent routing and lifecycle management
    - Integration with national and regional data-sharing infrastructures
- **AIIDA (Administrative Interface for In-house Data Access)** as a complementary component for in-house and near-real-time data
- Cooperation with European Standards Defining Organisations (e.g. IEC/CEN-CENELEC) to improve or create necessary data exchange standards, and to provide Open-Source technical reference implementations
- APIs, schemas, connectors, deployment tooling, and documentation
- Alignment with regulatory, interoperability, and standardisation initiatives
- Community-driven development under neutral governance

#### Out of Scope

- Centralised data hosting or brokerage
- Commercial data marketplaces or pricing mechanisms
- Proprietary extensions governed outside the project
- Operation of consumer-facing or utility services

EDDIE is **digital infrastructure**, not a service operator.

### 3. Guiding Principles

The EDDIE project follows these principles:

1. **Decentralisation by Design**  
   No mandatory central platform or single operator.

2. **Open Source First**  
   All core components are released under OSI-approved licenses.

3. **User Control & Consent**  
   Data access is always initiated, visible, and revocable by the data subject (as far as supported by underlying digital infrastructure).

4. **Non-Commercial Core**  
   The project infrastructure itself does not monetise data.

5. **Interoperability over Uniformity**  
   National and regional differences are respected and abstracted, not eliminated.

6. **Foundation Neutrality**  
   No single stakeholder controls the roadmap or direction.

7. **Close alignment with European regulatory developments**
   All EDDIE Framework and AIIDA components are closely aligned with these developments, and use the appropriate conceptual models and terminology.

### 4. Target Users and Stakeholders

- Energy service providers (commercial and non-commercial)
- Energy communities and citizen initiatives
- System operators and infrastructure providers
- Flexibility Service Providers
- Technical/DER Aggregators
- Researchers and academic institutions
- Policymakers and regulators
- Open-source developers

---

### 5. Governance Model

EDDIE follows standard Linux Foundation governance practices:

- A **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)** elected from active contributors
- Open technical decision-making and public roadmaps
- Transparent contribution, review, and release processes
- Merit-based participation
- Neutral hosting and stewardship under the **LFE Europe Foundation**

---

### 6. Relationship Between EDDIE and AIIDA

- **EDDIE Framework** provides the interoperable energy data middleware
- **AIIDA** extends the data space to in-house and near-real-time sources, plus communication with smart meters and behind-the-meter assets
- Both are governed as **closely aligned subprojects** under the same principles
