# Community Engagement Strategy

## Project EDDIE – European Distributed Data Infrastructure for Energy

Aligned with the principles and requirements of the Linux Foundation Energy (LFE).

---

## 1. Purpose and Alignment with Linux Foundation Energy Principles

This Community Engagement Strategy defines how **Project EDDIE (European Distributed Data Infrastructure for Energy)** builds, grows, and sustains an open, diverse, and vendor-neutral open-source ecosystem in line with Linux4Energy Foundation governance and community requirements.

The strategy explicitly supports:

- Open governance and transparency
- Vendor and technology neutrality
- Broad and growing participation
- Balanced contributions, ensuring **no single partner exceeds 50% of total commits**
- Long-term sustainability beyond project funding

Community engagement is treated as a **core technical and strategic activity**, fully integrated with architecture, documentation, release management, and governance.

---

## 2. Strong Foundations: Open Architecture and Documentation

EDDIE is built on a solid and openly accessible foundation. A **very comprehensive specification and architecture documentation** is publicly available at:

**https://architecture.eddie.energy**

This documentation:

- Describes EDDIE’s architecture, components, interfaces, and design principles
- Enables new contributors to understand and extend the system without insider knowledge
- Acts as the authoritative reference for implementation, extension, and review

The maturity and openness of this documentation significantly reduce onboarding effort and directly support open community participation.

## 3. Flagship Community Events

### 3.1 Digital Energy Data Services Contest

**Date & Location:** **7 May, Vienna 2026**  
**Format:** Eurovision Song Contest–inspired Hackathon

The **Digital Energy Data Services Contest** combines the collaborative nature of a hackathon with the celebratory and competitive spirit of the Eurovision Song Contest.

**Key characteristics:**

- Teams represent organizations, universities, startups, or mixed consortia
- Each team develops and presents a **digital energy data service built with or on top of EDDIE**
- Evaluation by a jury of open-source experts, system operators, and market actors
- Community voting complements expert scoring

**Objectives:**

- Attract new developers and organizations
- Validate EDDIE through real implementations
- Generate reusable open-source components
- Encourage first-time upstream contributions

---

### 3.2 Hackathon Preparation: “My First 14 Days with EDDIE”

To prepare the community for active participation, EDDIE publishes a tutorial-style article series:

**“My First 14 Days with EDDIE”**

The series:

- Guides developers through building **Smart Energy Community software** with EDDIE
- Combines architecture explanation with hands-on examples
- Targets newcomers, students, startups, and system operators

This content complements the formal architecture documentation with an experiential learning path.

---

### 3.3 EDDIE Closing Event

**Date:** June 2026

The **EDDIE Closing Event** serves as both a project milestone and a handover to long-term community-driven development.

**Objectives:**

- Present technical results and reference implementations
- Highlight contributions from newly onboarded organizations
- Transparently report on commit distribution and community KPIs
- Communicate the roadmap under LFE governance

---

## 4. Continuous Open Source Community Growth Strategy

### 4.1 Balanced Contributions and Ecosystem Expansion

To comply with LFE’s requirement that **no single partner contributes more than 50% of commits**, EDDIE follows a deliberate expansion strategy:

- Continuous onboarding of new organizations
- Encouraging adopters to become **active contributors**
- Modular architecture enabling partial and incremental contributions

**Monitoring and Governance**

- Commit shares per organization are continuously monitored
- Regular review by project governance
- Corrective outreach if imbalance trends emerge

---

### 4.2 EDDIE Ambassadors Program

A dedicated **EDDIE Ambassadors** network actively grows the ecosystem.

Ambassadors:

- Engage **universities** (student projects, courses, theses)
- Work with **DSOs and TSOs** to align with operational needs
- Reach out to **new market actors** (aggregators, flexibility providers, data services)
- Support stakeholders in submitting **code change proposals and pull requests**

---

### 4.3 Developer-Centric Communication, Releases, and Reporting

#### Monthly “EDDIE Cookbook” Articles

- One **EDDIE Cookbook** article published **monthly on LinkedIn**
